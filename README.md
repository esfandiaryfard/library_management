# library_management
This app is a library management system, and this is is just simple project I wrote for a job intreview question. Its all in django and django restframework and its using jwt for login! 

you can user default username and password :
username: admin
password:2345678
in order to access admin panel

Is good to know that authentication method for this project is jwt 

Just it:) Enjoy it and have fun:)
